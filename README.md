## Why?

I created this to improve my front end skills. 

Apple is known for its incredible products so creating a website that attracts customers and finalize the purchase is crucial in its business model. 

I chose to use the Apple website because all the front-end elements present are crafted in order to sell to the customer what a revolutionary product they have. It's a time-tested formula that transformed Apple into a $4 trillion market cap company. 

Having done some elements, I can see just how user-friendly the experience is navigating the website.
